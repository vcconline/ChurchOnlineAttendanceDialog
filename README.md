At the time of this writing, the Church Online Platform does not provide a way of capturing the number of people who may be watching on a single session. This project allows you to fill that gap by creating a popup dialog which prompts the user for the number of people watching, and then sends that data to Google Analytics. The data can then be rolled up in a Google Data Studio report, or directly in Google Analytics.
