# Church Online Attendance Dialog
Attendance dialog for the Church Online Platform (free live church platform by Life.Church https://churchonlineplatform.com/)
## Description
Add a popup dialog to capture attendance when users go to your Church Online instance. At the time of this writing, the Church Online Platform does not provide a way of capturing the number of people who may be watching on a single session. This project allows you to fill that gap by creating a popup dialog which prompts the user for the number of people watching, and then sends that data to Google Analytics.
